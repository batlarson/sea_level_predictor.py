# ðŸŒŠ Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the **Data Analysis with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.  
It analyzes sea level rise data and uses linear regression to project future sea levels until the year 2050.

## ðŸ§  Project Description

The goal of this project is to perform simple linear regression using historical data from the **EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)**.  
The analysis visualizes both the long-term and modern trends of global sea level rise.

Two lines of best fit are plotted:
1. **1880â€“2018:** Long-term trend based on all available data.
2. **2000â€“2018:** Recent trend showing accelerated sea level rise.

## ðŸ“ˆ What the Program Does

- Reads the EPA sea level dataset (`epa-sea-level.csv`).
- Creates a **scatter plot** of the measured data.
- Calculates and plots two **lines of best fit**:
  - One using all data.
  - One using data from 2000 onwards.
- Projects sea level rise up to the year **2050**.
- Saves the final chart as `sea_level_plot.png`.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- SciPy (for linear regression)
